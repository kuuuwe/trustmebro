Description: trustmebro is designed to make data wrangling with ID-related aspects more comfortable.
  This package provides functions that make it easy to inspect various subject-generated ID codes (SGIC) for plausibility.
  It also helps with inspecting other common identifiers, ensuring that your data stays clean and reliable.
  Beyond plausibility checks, trustmebro offers a few tools for smooth data import and convenient recoding.
